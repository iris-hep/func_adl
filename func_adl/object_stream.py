class ObjectStream:
    r'''
    The objects can be events, jets, electrons, or just floats, or arrays of floats.

    `ObjectStream` holds onto the AST that will produce this stream of objects. The chain
    of `ObjectStream` objects, linked together, is a DAG that stores the user's intent.

    Every stream has an _object type_. This is the type of the elements of the stream. For example,
    the top stream, the objects are of type `Event` (or `xADOEvent`). If you transform an `Event` into
    a list of jets, then the object type will be a list of `Jet` objects. Each element of the stream
    is an array. You can also lift this second array of `Jets` and turn it into a plain stream
    of `Jets` using the `SelectMany` method below. In that case, you'll no longer be able to tell
    the boundary between events.

        Given the current stream's object type is an array or other iterable, return
        the items in this objects type, one-by-one. This has the effect of flattening a
        nested array.

        Arguments:

            func:   The function that should be applied to this stream's objects to return
                    an iterable. Each item of the iterable is now the stream of objects.

        Apply a transformation function to each object in the stream, yielding a new type of
        object. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input objects and output objects.

        Arguments:

        Filter the object stream, allowing only items for which `filter` evaluates as true through.

        Arguments:

            filter      A filter lambda that returns True/False.

        Returns:

        Return a pandas stream that contains one item, an pandas `DataFrame`.
        This `DataFrame` will contain all the data fed to it. Only non-array datatypes are permitted:
        the data must look like an Excel table.

        Arguments:

            columns     Array of names of the columns. Will default to "col0", "call1", etc.
                        Exception will be thrown if the number of columns do not match.

    def AsROOTTTree(self, filename, treename, columns=[]) -> 'ObjectStream':
        r"""
        Return the sequence of items as a ROOT TTree. Each item in the ObjectStream
        will get one entry in the file. The items must be of types that the infrastructure
        can work with:

            Float               A tree with a single float in each entry will be written.
            vector<float>       A tree with a list of floats in each entry will be written.
            (<tuple>)           A tree with multiple items (leaves) will be written. Each leaf
                                must have one of the above types. Nested tuples are not supported.

        Arguments:

            filename        Name of the file in which a TTree of the objects will be written.
            treename        Name of the tree to be written to the file
            columns         Array of names of the columns. This must match the number of items
                            in a tuple to be written out.

        Returns:

            A new ObjectStream with type [(filename, treename)]. This is because multiple tree's
            may be written by the back end, and need to be concatenated together to get the full

    def AsAwkwardArray(self, columns=[]) -> 'ObjectStream':
        r'''
        Return a pandas stream that contains one item, an `awkward` array, or dictionary of `awkward` arrays.
        This `awkward` will contain all the data fed to it.

        Arguments:

            columns     Array of names of the columns. Will default to "col0", "call1", etc.
                        Exception will be thrown if the number of columns do not match.

        Returns an executor that can be used to run this.
        Logic seperated out as it is used from several different places.

        Arguments:
            executor            Callback to run the AST. Can be synchronous or coroutine.

        Returns:
            An executor that is either synchronous or a coroutine.

    async def value_async(self, executor: Callable[[ast.AST], Any] = None) -> Any:
        r'''
        Evaluate the ObjectStream computation graph. Tracks back to the source dataset to
        understand how to evaluate the AST. It is possible to pass in an executor to override that
        behavior (used mostly for testing).

        Arguments:

            executor        A function that when called with the ast will return a future for the
                            result. If None, then uses the default executor. Normally is none
                            and the default executor specified by the `EventDatasource` is called
                            instead.

        Returns

            The first element of the ObjectStream after evaluation.


        Note

            This is the non-blocking version - it will return a future which can
            be `await`ed upon until the query is done.
